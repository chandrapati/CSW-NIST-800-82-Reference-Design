# Cisco Secure Workload — NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3
## Reference Design | IT-Side Boundary to OT / ICS Environments

**Version:** 1.0  
**Framework:** NIST Special Publication 800-82 Revision 3 — *Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security* (NIST, September 2023)  
**Use Case:** IT-side segmentation of OT zones, IT/OT DMZ workload control, OT-adjacent monitoring service segmentation, IT/OT communication path evidence

> **Framework version note.** NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 is *guidance*, not a separate control catalogue. It uses NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 as its underlying control framework and provides an OT-tailored overlay and OT-specific guidance. This reference design references **800-82 topic areas** (e.g. cybersecurity programme, network architecture, segmentation, incident response) and the **800-53 control families** the overlay aligns to. Specific control selection and tailoring must be done against the customer's OT cybersecurity programme and the 800-53 baseline they apply.
>
> **Scope boundary.** CSW is a workload-segmentation product. The deep OT device layer (PLCs, RTUs, HMIs, controllers, OT protocols like Modbus, DNP3, S7, OPC UA) is **not** within CSW's direct enforcement scope and is better addressed by an OT-native product (e.g. Cisco Cyber Vision, Claroty xDome, Nozomi). CSW's role is to harden the **IT-side workloads adjacent to OT** — historians, engineering workstations, jump hosts, IT/OT DMZ workloads, asset / vulnerability servers, and monitoring servers — and to evidence the IT-side of the IT/OT communication boundary.
>
> **CSW UI navigation note.** Cisco does not yet publish 800-82-specific CSW UI navigation; framework-specific paths are on the product roadmap. This reference design describes CSW *capabilities* and the *evidence artifacts* they produce.

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Industrial / critical infrastructure operators (manufacturing, energy, water, transportation, pharma, food production) and any organisation with an OT estate whose IT-side boundary must demonstrate segmentation hygiene; CISO / OT security lead, IT and OT engineering, internal audit, and consultants preparing a 800-82-aligned assessment.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *Can I demonstrate that IT workloads with reach into the IT/OT DMZ or into OT zones are inventoried, classified, and segmented?* (800-82 network architecture topic; 800-53 AC, SC, CM families)
- *Can I evidence that the IT/OT communication boundary is constrained to approved flows only?* (800-82 segmentation; 800-53 SC-7 / AC-4)
- *Can I produce monitoring evidence on the IT side of the IT/OT boundary?* (800-82 monitoring topic; 800-53 SI-4 / AU family)
- *Can I prioritise patching of IT-side workloads whose reachability is into OT zones?* (800-82 vulnerability management; 800-53 RA / SI-2)
- *In the event of an incident, can I reconstruct IT-side workload flow to/from OT zones?* (800-82 incident response; 800-53 IR family)

**What you'll need.** IT asset inventory, OT asset inventory (from your OT-native product), an architecture diagram showing IT zones, IT/OT DMZ, and OT zones (e.g. ISA-95 levels 3.5–4), the OT cybersecurity programme document, and a list of historians / engineering workstations / IT/OT DMZ workloads in scope.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you are scoping; 5–7 if you are designing and simulating policy; 9–10 if you are preparing an assessment / audit pack within the next quarter.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

**Read next:** [Compliance evidence playbook](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Reference-Designs/blob/main/docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md) (full step-by-step) · [About CSW](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Reference-Designs/blob/main/docs/about-csw.md) (platform intro)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- OT-adjacent IT segmentation (jump hosts, historians, patch repos)
- Pair with OT visibility for end-to-end zones
- Vendor access path documentation

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

## 1. Overview

NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 is OT-tailored guidance over NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5. Its key technical themes for the IT-side workload layer are:

- A **cybersecurity programme** that integrates OT considerations
- A **network architecture** that segregates IT from OT (commonly described as ISA-95 levels with a DMZ at level 3.5 between the manufacturing zone (3) and the enterprise zone (4–5))
- Continuous **monitoring** with OT-tailored considerations (e.g. minimising disruption)
- **Access control** at zone boundaries
- **Vulnerability management** with OT-specific change-management constraints
- **Incident response** with OT-specific operational concerns

CSW supports the **IT-side** of these themes by:

- Inventorying IT-side workloads adjacent to the OT estate
- Producing reachability evidence into the IT/OT DMZ and across the boundary
- Enforcing workload-level allowlist policy at the IT/OT boundary on the IT side
- Producing monitoring telemetry and policy-violation alerts
- Producing reachability-weighted vulnerability evidence so patch prioritisation reflects OT-adjacency
- Producing forensic flow + process timelines on the IT side for incident response

What CSW does **not** do for 800-82: enforce policy on OT devices, parse OT protocols, manage OT change windows, replace the OT-native product, or replace the OT cybersecurity programme.

### 800-82 Topic Areas and CSW Relevance

| 800-82 topic area | CSW relevance (IT side) | Underlying 800-53 control family (representative) |
|---|---|---|
| OT cybersecurity programme | Evidence inputs (inventory, telemetry) | PM family |
| Network architecture and segmentation | Workload-level segmentation on IT-side; ADM-derived allowlist; policy workspace | SC-7, AC-4 |
| Monitoring | Continuous flow / process telemetry; anomaly alerts | SI-4, AU family |
| Access control | Workload-to-workload allowlist on IT side | AC-3, AC-4, AC-6 |
| Vulnerability management | Reachability-weighted CVE evidence | RA-5, SI-2 |
| Incident response | Forensic flow / process telemetry | IR family |
| Configuration / change management | Baseline policy workspace + change log | CM family |

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] CSW cluster provisioned
- [ ] Sensor compatibility verified on **IT-side** workloads only (historians, engineering workstations, IT/OT DMZ workloads, jump hosts, asset / vulnerability servers, monitoring servers). Do not install CSW sensors on OT devices.
- [ ] OT-native product (Cyber Vision / Claroty / Nozomi) confirmed for OT zones
- [ ] IT/OT architecture diagram reviewed; the IT/OT DMZ boundary defined unambiguously
- [ ] Stakeholders: CISO, OT security lead, OT operations lead, internal audit
- [ ] Change windows agreed with OT operations (sensor install on engineering workstations is operationally sensitive)
- [ ] Evidence retention agreed with internal audit and OT engineering

---

## 3. Phase 1 — IT-Side Sensor & Connector Deployment (Days 1–5)

- Install software sensors only on **IT-side** workloads in monitoring mode
- Connect cloud accounts for cloud-hosted IT workloads in scope (e.g. cloud historian, cloud SCADA front-end)
- Day-1 labels: `application`, `env`, `isa_level`, `it_or_ot`, `criticality`, `owner`, `compliance=nist-800-82`
- Maintain a `cannot-instrument` register for OT devices and any appliances; this register is itself evidence (it documents the boundary of CSW's coverage)
- Retain Phase-1 sensor inventory baseline

---

## 4. Phase 2 — IT/OT Scope Architecture (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 Suggested Scope Architecture

```
Root Scope
└── NIST-800-82
    ├── OT-Adjacent-IT                       (Level 3.5 IT/OT DMZ — IT-side workloads)
    │   ├── Historians
    │   ├── Patch-Servers-OT-Direction
    │   ├── Engineering-Workstations
    │   └── Jump-Hosts-to-OT
    ├── OT-Monitoring-IT-Side                (CSW-instrumented IT-side monitoring servers)
    ├── Enterprise-IT                        (Level 4–5 enterprise systems)
    └── OT-Zones                             (Level 0–3 — NOT instrumented by CSW; referenced via flow visibility only)
```

CSW will **not** have sensors inside OT-Zones; it observes the IT-side endpoint of every IT↔OT flow.

### 4.2 Inventory Filters

```
Filter: OT-Adjacent-IT-Candidates
  - Tag: it_or_ot = it-side
  - Tag: isa_level = 3.5
  - Hostname / app pattern matches: historian, engineering, ot-jump

Filter: Jump-Hosts-to-OT
  - Listening port: 22, 3389
  - Tag: purpose = ot-admin
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

| Label key | Example values | Why it matters for 800-82 |
|---|---|---|
| `isa_level` | 4, 3.5, 3, 2, 1 | Reflects ISA-95 architectural level commonly used in 800-82 references |
| `it_or_ot` | it-side, ot-side | Anchors the boundary CSW evidences |
| `application` | historian, mes, engineering-workstation | Maps workloads to OT-adjacent systems |
| `env` | production, dev, lab | Production OT-adjacent workloads need stricter controls |
| `criticality` | critical, important, standard | Risk tiering |
| `owner` | <function> | Accountability |
| `compliance` | nist-800-82 | Filters CSW evidence to 800-82 scope |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Application Dependency Mapping (Days 11–21)

Run ADM on the IT-side scopes. For 800-82, the most important questions are about **boundary** flows:

| Question | 800-82 / 800-53 reference |
|---|---|
| Which IT workloads communicate with OT-Zones, and on what ports / protocols? | SC-7, AC-4 |
| Which IT workloads in OT-Adjacent-IT communicate with Enterprise-IT? | SC-7, AC-4 |
| Are flows into OT-Zones constrained to approved historians, engineering workstations, or jump hosts? | AC-3, AC-4, AC-6 |
| Are jump-host flows to OT-Zones audited? | AC-6, AU family |
| Which IT-side OT-adjacent workloads have direct or transitive reach to the internet? | SC-7 |

Use ADM to confirm or correct `isa_level`, `it_or_ot`, and `application` labels.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Development (Days 22–35)

### 6.1 800-82-Aligned Policy Framework (IT side)

**Absolute policies:**

```
DENY  Enterprise-IT             → OT-Zones                    (no direct enterprise → OT)
DENY  OT-Adjacent-IT            → Internet                    (no direct internet egress from OT-adjacent IT)
DENY  Any                       → OT-Zones                    (default deny inbound from the IT side)
```

**Allowlist policies (examples to adapt per environment):**

```
ALLOW Historians                → OT-Zones                    tcp/<approved-ot-protocol-via-DMZ>
ALLOW Engineering-Workstations  → OT-Zones                    tcp/<approved-engineering-protocol>
ALLOW Jump-Hosts-to-OT          → OT-Zones                    tcp/22, tcp/3389
ALLOW OT-Adjacent-IT            → OT-Monitoring-IT-Side       tcp/443
ALLOW Patch-Servers             → OT-Adjacent-IT              tcp/<approved-update-port>
```

**Catch-all (audit everything else):**

```
LOG   Any                       → OT-Adjacent-IT              (unmatched inbound)
LOG   OT-Adjacent-IT            → Any                         (unmatched outbound)
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Lifecycle

Even more conservative than IT-only frameworks; OT operations cannot tolerate accidental denial:

| Phase | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 4 weeks | Validate against live traffic; long observation window for OT cycles |
| 2 | Enforcement of high-confidence rules only | 2 weeks | Enterprise→OT deny, internet egress deny |
| 3 | Full Enforcement on IT side | Ongoing | OT-side enforcement remains with the OT-native product |

Snapshot the workspace at every phase transition; this is evidence for SC-7 / AC-4 / CM family.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — 800-82 Topic Mapping with CSW Evidence

| 800-82 topic | What CSW produces | How to use it (800-53 family) |
|---|---|---|
| Network architecture and segmentation | Policy workspace; observed IT↔OT flows; ADM-derived allowlist | SC-7, AC-4 evidence on the IT side of the boundary |
| Monitoring | Continuous flow / process telemetry; alerts on unauthorised IT↔OT flow | SI-4, AU family |
| Access control | Workload-to-workload allowlist + enforcement log | AC-3, AC-4, AC-6 |
| Vulnerability management | Reachability-weighted CVE on OT-adjacent IT workloads | RA-5, SI-2 |
| Incident response | Forensic flow / process search across the incident window | IR family |
| Configuration management | Workspace snapshot before/after each change | CM family |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability Management (IT-side, OT-aware)

OT environments often have constrained patch windows. CSW's role on the IT side:

```
Priority 1: Critical CVE on OT-Adjacent-IT with inbound reachability
Priority 2: Critical CVE on Jump-Hosts-to-OT
Priority 3: Critical CVE on Patch-Servers / OT-Monitoring-IT-Side
```

If a patch must be delayed (common in OT-adjacent environments), use CSW to:

- Restrict the vulnerable port to an explicit approved source list
- Add an anomaly alert on the affected process
- Log all connections to the affected workload
- Document the exception in the policy workspace exception register

The exception register itself is evidence for RA / SI-2 risk acceptance and CM change control.

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring & Alerting

| Alert | Trigger | 800-82 topic |
|---|---|---|
| Unapproved IT→OT flow | New flow from any IT workload → OT-Zones outside approved baseline | Segmentation |
| Enterprise→OT attempt | Enterprise-IT → OT-Zones (any) | Segmentation |
| Jump-host activity outside change window | Jump-Hosts-to-OT → OT-Zones outside an authorised change window | Access control |
| Plaintext on regulated paths | HTTP / unencrypted protocol from OT-Adjacent-IT | Communications (detection) |
| Policy violation | Enforced policy block triggered | Segmentation / Access control |
| Sensor offline | Agent stops reporting on an OT-Adjacent-IT workload | Monitoring evidence integrity |

### 9.2 Forensic Telemetry

Per incident, retain on the IT side:

- Flow log scoped to affected IT workload(s) and time window (with process context)
- Process search output
- Policy workspace state at the time of the incident
- Vulnerability snapshot for the affected workload(s)
- Pair with the OT-native product's view of the OT side to produce a complete picture

---

## 10. Reporting & Evidence Collection

### 10.1 Evidence per Audit Cycle (quarterly recommended)

| Evidence item | CSW source area | 800-82 topic |
|---|---|---|
| IT-side workload inventory adjacent to OT | Inventory export | Programme / asset evidence |
| Scope + label membership (`isa_level`, `it_or_ot`) | Scope membership export | Segmentation |
| Approved vs. observed IT↔OT flows | ADM workspace export | Segmentation |
| Policy workspace snapshot | Policy workspace export | Segmentation / change control |
| Policy enforcement / violations | Policy analysis output | Access control / monitoring |
| Vulnerability + reachability (OT-adjacent IT) | Vulnerability report scoped to NIST-800-82 | Vulnerability management |
| Jump-host activity report | Flow search on Jump-Hosts-to-OT | Access control / monitoring |
| Incident timeline (IT-side) | Flow + process search | Incident response |
| Exception register | Policy workspace exceptions list | Configuration / risk acceptance |

### 10.2 Ongoing Compliance Posture

- **Monthly:** scope / inventory hygiene; jump-host activity review
- **Quarterly:** policy workspace review; refresh evidence pack 10.1
- **Annually:** independent walk-through with OT engineering and internal audit
- **Continuously:** policy drift detection; ADM re-run every 90 days

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Trying to instrument OT devices with CSW | Use an OT-native product for OT devices; CSW is for IT-side workloads |
| Treating 800-82 as a standalone control catalogue | 800-82 is OT-tailored guidance over 800-53; cite 800-53 controls for the actual control language |
| Skipping the simulation window for OT-adjacent workloads | Use a 4-week simulation; OT cycles are long |
| Enforcing IT-side rules without coordinating with OT operations | All policy enforcement on OT-adjacent IT requires OT engineering sign-off |
| Assuming network protocol by port (e.g. Modbus on TCP/502) | Confirm by process + observed handshake where possible; OT protocols vary |
| Treating CSW jump-host visibility as session monitoring | CSW shows the flow; session-level command recording is a PAM responsibility |
